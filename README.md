# STM32 Nucleo 3D printer controller

This project concerns the replacement of Teensylu 3D printer controller board on a [uDelta RepRap printer](https://reprap.org/wiki/Micro_Delta). An STM32 NUCLEO-F446RE expansion board (shield) is currently being developed as the replacement. After the board is designed and fabricated, the Marlin open source firmware will be configured for use with the Nucleo board.
